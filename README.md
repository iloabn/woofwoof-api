# WoofWoof API

A simple API for displaying dog images. You need to access to a MongoDB database instance for project to work. You can either start MongoDB locally or by setting the environment variable `MONGODB_URL` to point to your MongoDB instance.

1. Run `npm install`.
2. Run `npm run dev`.

Have a look at <./api-requests.http> for examples of how to interact with this API.
